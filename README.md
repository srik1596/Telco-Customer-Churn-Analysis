Telco Customer Churn Analysis
Dataset: Telco_customer_churn.xlsx
Overview: This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a telecommunications company. The workflow includes data preprocessing, encoding categorical features, standardizing numerical columns, and applying a Random Forest Classifier to determine feature importance.
Steps Performed:
1.	Data Loading: Imported the dataset into a Jupyter Notebook and explored its structure.
2.	Data Cleaning: Handled missing values appropriately to ensure completeness.
3.	Label Encoding: Applied LabelEncoder to binary categorical columns.
4.	One-Hot Encoding: Transformed multi-class categorical features using OneHotEncoder.
5.	Feature Standardization: Standardized numerical columns using StandardScaler for model readiness.
6.	Modeling & Feature Importance:
  	Applied Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn.
    Visualized the feature importance to identify key factors influencing churn.
Outcome:
This analysis provides insights into which features most strongly impact customer churn, helping business stakeholders make data-driven decisions for retention strategies.
